# TicTacToe w/ AI
Hey there,

This is my own TicTacToe game I created outside of school when I first began to learn Java GUI. I added my own version of an AI system
which works well enough to beat a human player a few times. I built this project approximately a 6 months ago (September 2015). Since
then I have learned much more on programming and developing software. As such, the code may appear written in a procedural way but I
tried to compensate by document what my thoughts were in the process. I haven't worked on the project since I finished it, although I do
plan on revisiting it and doing major refactoring to display my newly acquired knowledge. Thanks for reading!
